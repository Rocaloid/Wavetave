Wavetave
========

Audio signal processing utility sandbox in octave language.

The aim of Wavetave is to test and design algorithms for Rocaloid.

* Wavetave is specifically written for Octave but **not matlab**.

* Depends on `gnuplot`.

The main component of Wavetave is a Spectrum Visualizer, located at `src/SpectrumVisualizer.m`

To get it running on your computer:

`$ cd src`

`$ octave`

`$ SpectrumVisualizer`

You can configure the plugins by modifying the source, as described in `SpectrumVisualizer.m`
